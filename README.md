## 1.	Introduction

In this project, I build Classification model to study the relationship between Diabetes Outcome of a patient and different continous and discrete variables. I implemented this classification model in Python programming language using Scikit-learn,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

## 2.	Python libraries

 •	Numpy

 •	Pandas

 •	Matplotlib

 •	Seaborn

 •	Scikit-Learn

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

## 3.	The problem statement

The main aim of this model is to predicting weather a person has a diabetes or not on the basis of different attributes. Finding relationship or dependency of Output on attrubutes like Pregnancies, Insulin and other variables.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

## 4.	Classification Algorithms

  1.  LogisticRegression
  2.  DecisionTreeClassifier
  3.  RandomForestClassifier
  4.  SVC
  5.  KNeighborsClassifier
  6.  GaussianNB

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

## 5.   Independent and Dependent Variables

### Independent variable

Independent or Input variable (X) = Feature variable = Predictor variable

The following are the independent variable:-

  1. Pregnancies
  2. Glucose
  3. BloodPressure
  4. SkinThickness
  5. Insulin
  6. BMI
  7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  8. Age

### Dependent variable

Dependent or Output variable (y) = Target variable = Response variable

The following is the dependent variable:-

  1. Outcome

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


## 6.	Interpretation and Conclusion

Among all the classification algorithm used in the model SVC(Support Vector Classifier) fit best among them to data and provide the highest accuracy score and F1-score.

  Accuracy Score : 80%
  F1-Score : 70%
